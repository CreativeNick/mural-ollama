# MurAI - Multimodal Mural Assistant
Multimodal LLM Mural Assistant with Ollama

## About the Project
MurAI is a multimodal LLM assistant designed to analyze and extract information from Mural.co screenshots. This tool is meant to help users quickly understand and interact with Mural content.

### Project Vision
A general multimodal LLM assistant would greatly help the office navigate large amounts of information quicker and more efficiently. This prototype aims to lay the groundwork for future LLM projects at CMS.
